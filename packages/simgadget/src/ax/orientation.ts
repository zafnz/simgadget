 * that keep different company. The *aspect* — portrait-family or
 * landscape-family — is visible in every root frame, so it comes free with any
 * read and there is no excuse for the hint to contradict it. The *chirality* —
 * which landscape, portrait or upside-down — is invisible to a describe,
 * because the two members of a pair produce byte-identical geometry; only a
 * probe (`detectOrientation`) or a rotation we ordered ourselves can settle it,
 * and the probe costs too much to run inside every tap.
 *
 * So: a frame that agrees with the hint's aspect tells us nothing new and must
 * leave the hint alone, or every describe would throw away the chirality that
 * cost a probe to learn. A frame that disagrees proves the hint is stale —
 * something rotated the device behind our back — and retiring it to "auto"
 * hands `getEffectiveOrientation` back the job of reading the shape, which is
 * the best answer available until someone probes again.
